    In the card game poker, a hand consists of five cards

        High Card: Highest value card.
        One Pair: Two cards of the same value.
        Two Pairs: Two different pairs.
        Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same value.
        Straight: All cards are consecutive values.
        Flush: All cards of the same suit.
        Full House: Three of a kind and a pair.
        Four of a Kind: Four cards of the same value.
        Straight Flush: All cards are consecutive values of same suit.
        Royal Flush: Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, in same suit.
    
    The cards are valued in the order:
    2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.
    
    If two players have the same ranked hands then the rank made up of
    the highest value wins; for example, a pair of eights beats a pair
    of fives (see example 1 below). But if two ranks tie, for example,
    both players have a pair of queens, then highest cards in each
    hand are compared (see example 4 below); if the highest cards tie
    then the next highest cards are compared, and so on.

    Hand | Player 1 | Player 2 | Winner
