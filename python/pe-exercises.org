** 1000-digits Fibonacci number PE-25
*** Problem Statement
    The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:
    
    #+HEADER: :exports results
    #+HEADER: :results (by-backend (pdf "latex") (t "raw"))
    #+BEGIN_SRC latex
      \begin{equation*}
        F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2},\; \textit{where}\; F_1 = 1\; \textit{and} \; F_2 = 1\;.
      \end{equation*}
    #+END_SRC
    
    Hence the first 12 terms will be:
    
    #+HEADER: :exports results
    #+HEADER: :results (by-backend (pdf "latex") (t "raw"))
    #+BEGIN_SRC latex
      \begin{align*}
        F_1    &= 1   \\
        F_2    &= 1   \\
        F_3    &= 2   \\
        F_4    &= 3   \\
        F_5    &= 5   \\
        F_6    &= 8   \\
        F_7    &= 13  \\
        F_8    &= 21  \\
        F_9    &= 34  \\
        F_{10} &= 55  \\
        F_{11} &= 89  \\
        F_{12} &= 144
      \end{align*}
    #+END_SRC
    
    The $12^{th}$ term, $F_{12}$, is the first term to contain three digits.
    
    What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence 
    to contain 1000 digits?

*** Discussion
    Start with some initial guess: $fib(1000)$ and double the size until we find
    a number with more than 1000 digits once done, subtract the half of the last
    increment, depending on whether we overshoot or undershoot subtract or add
    the quarter of the last increment and so on, until we find two adjacent
    Fibonacci numbers such that the first has at most 999 digits and the second
    has 1000 or more digits.  This will ensure that we calculate at most
    $log(1000) \approx 10$ operations.  Afterwards, because there could be
    several Fibonacci numbers of the same length, we'll find the smallest one
    using linear search (this won't take more than $log(2^4) = 4$ operations.)

*** Solution

    #+HEADER: :exports both
    #+BEGIN_SRC python
      from combinatorics import fib, digits

      n = 1000
      guess = fib(n)
      while len(digits(guess)) < 1000:
          n *= 2
          guess = fib(n)
      m = n // 4
      n -= m
      while m > 1:
          guess = fib(n)
          m //= 2
          if len(digits(guess)) > 1000:
              n -= m
          else:
              n += m
      while len(digits(guess)) >= 1000:
          n -= 1
          guess = fib(n)
      return n + 1

** Goldbach's other conjecture PE-46
*** Problem statement
    It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be
    written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.
    
    #+HEADER: :exports results
    #+HEADER: :results (by-backend (pdf "latex") (t "raw"))
    #+BEGIN_SRC latex
      \begin{align*}
        9  &= 7  + 2 \times 12 \\
        15 &= 7  + 2 \times 22 \\
        21 &= 3  + 2 \times 32 \\
        25 &= 7  + 2 \times 32 \\
        27 &= 19 + 2 \times 22 \\
        33 &= 31 + 2 \times 12
      \end{align*}
    #+END_SRC
    
    It turns out that the conjecture was false.
    
    What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a
    prime and twice a square?

*** Discussion
    There doesn't seem to be an easier way than just a brute-force search.  In
    other words, the code simply generates subsequent odd composite numbers and
    tests whether the number complies with the contstraints of conjecture.

*** Solution
    #+HEADER: :exports both
    #+BEGIN_SRC python
      import math
      from primes import odd_composite, primes

      def decomposes_goldbach(n):
          """
          Returns True iff n can be decomposed into p + 2 * i^2, where
          p is a prime and i is an integer.
          """
          for p in primes():
              if p > n:
                  return False
              rest = n - p
              if rest % 2 == 0 and int(math.sqrt(rest // 2)) ** 2 == rest // 2:
                  return True

      for c in odd_composite():
          if not decomposes_goldbach(c):
              return c

    #+RESULTS:

** Largest sum of consequtive primes PE-50
*** Problem statement
    The prime 41, can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes:

    #+HEADER: :exports results
    #+HEADER: :results (by-backend (pdf "latex") (t "raw"))
    #+BEGIN_SRC latex
      \begin{align*}
        41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13
      \end{align*}
    #+END_SRC

    This is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds to a prime
    below one-hundred.

    The longest sum of consecutive primes below one-thousand that adds
    to a prime, contains 21 terms, and is equal to 953.

    Which prime, below one-million, can be written as the sum of the
    most consecutive primes?

*** Discussion
    In the preparation phase the code generates all primes which add up to less
    than a million, while at the same time calculating sums of the primes
    generated so far.  This acts as a cache for the sums we would have to
    calculate repeatedly whenever we'd verify every other sequence of primes.

    During the next step the code choses sums in order of decreasing number of
    summands, iteratively updating the maximum prime for the longest sequence
    found so far.  Once no sums of the longest-so-far sequence can be found,
    the lagorithm terminates.

*** Solution
    #+HEADER: :exports both
    #+BEGIN_SRC python
      from primes import primes, is_prime

      sieve, prefixes, max_prime, longest_seq = [], [0], 0, 0
      for p in primes():
          if prefixes[-1] + p > 1000000:
              break
          sieve.append(p)
          prefixes.append(prefixes[-1] + p)
      terms = 1
      for i in range(len(prefixes)):
          for j in range(i + terms, len(prefixes)):
              n = prefixes[j] - prefixes[i]
              if j - i > terms:
                  is_p, sieve = is_prime(n, sieve)
                  if is_p:
                      terms, max_prime = j - i, n
      return max_prime

** Poker game PE-54
*** Problem statement
    In the card game poker, a hand consists of five cards 
    and are ranked, from lowest to highest, in the following way:
    
    + High Card :: Highest value card.
    + One Pair :: Two cards of the same value.
    + Two Pairs :: Two different pairs.
    + Three of a Kind :: Three cards of the same value.
    + Straight :: All cards are consecutive values.
    + Flush :: All cards of the same suit.
    + Full House :: Three of a kind and a pair.
    + Four of a Kind :: Four cards of the same value.
    + Straight Flush :: All cards are consecutive values of same suit.
    + Royal Flush :: Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, in same suit.

    The cards are valued in the order:

    #+HEADER: :exports results
    #+HEADER: :results (by-backend (pdf "latex") (t "raw"))
    #+BEGIN_SRC latex
      \begin{align*}
        2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.
      \end{align*}
    #+END_SRC
    
    If two players have the same ranked hands then the rank made up of the
    highest value wins; for example, a pair of eights beats a pair of fives (see
    example 1 below). But if two ranks tie, for example, both players have a
    pair of queens, then highest cards in each hand are compared (see example 4
    below); if the highest cards tie then the next highest cards are compared,
    and so on.
    
    Consider the following five hands dealt to two players:

    | Player 1          | Player 2            | Winner   |
    |-------------------+---------------------+----------|
    | 5H 5C 6S 7S KD    | 2C 3S 8S 8D TD      | Player 2 |
    | Pair of Fives     | Pair of Eights      |          |
    |-------------------+---------------------+----------|
    | 5D 8C 9S JS AC    | 2C 5C 7D 8S QH      | Player 1 |
    | Highest card Ace  | Highest card Queen  |          |
    |-------------------+---------------------+----------|
    | 2D 9C AS AH AC    | 3D 6D 7D TD QD      | Player 2 |
    | Three Aces        | Flush with Diamonds |          |
    |-------------------+---------------------+----------|
    | 4D 6S 9H QH QC    | 3D 6D 7H QD QS      | Player 1 |
    | Pair of Queens    | Pair of Queens      |          |
    | Highest card Nine | Highest card Seven  |          |
    |-------------------+---------------------+----------|
    | 2H 2D 4C 4D 4S    | 3C 3D 3S 9S 9D      | Player 1 |
    | Full House        | Full House          |          |
    | With Three Fours  | with Three Threes   |          |
    
    The file, poker.txt, contains one-thousand random hands dealt to two
    players. Each line of the file contains ten cards (separated by a single
    space): the first five are Player 1's cards and the last five are Player 2's
    cards. You can assume that all hands are valid (no invalid characters or
    repeated cards), each player's hand is in no specific order, and in each
    hand there is a clear winner.
    
    How many hands does Player 1 win?

*** Discussion
    Player's hand will be represented by a class =Hand=.  This class is
    initalized with the raw card data.  During initialization the cards are
    sorted in order from least to highest denomination.  =Hand= class will aslo
    implement operators required for comparison.  Once such operator is called,
    the code will determine (and cache):

    1. The value of the hand.  Hands are given values using the following scheme:
       + If no special combination is found (s.a. /flush/), then the hand is
         worth as much as its highest denomination card.
       + Special denominations recieve one point more than the highest card,
         plus their relative rank, i.e. /one pair/ receives 15, /two pairs/
         recieves 16 and so on.
       + Ties aren't broken at this time.
    2. The stretches of cards of the same denomination.
    3. If the code encounters a tie, it tries to break it using the rules given
       below.
       + Given the =stretches= information the code will select only the cards
         that will influence the decision.
       + Compare selected cards in order from highest to lowest denomination.
         
    The =cards_txt= file can be found in [[../etc/p054_poker.txt]].

*** Solution

    #+BEGIN_SRC python

      with open(cards_txt, 'r') as f:
          wins = 0
          for line in f:
              cards = line.strip().split(" ")
              if Hand(cards[:5]) > Hand(cards[5:]):
                  wins += 1
          return wins
